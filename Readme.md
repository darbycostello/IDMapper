IDMapper simplifies creation and editing of vertex color layers that can be used as ID-maps
in texturing software like Substance Painter or Quixel. It aims to reduce the time it takes 
to create an ID-map significantly, especially for complex hard surface models.

It uses powerful heuristics to create an ID-map from scratch and lets you interactively 
adjust the results. It offers options to use existing information, like uv-seams, 
but can also intelligently assign the same color to similar mesh parts. 

You can even paint faces by hand in a way that unlike regular vertex painting allows you to
apply uniform colors to to entire faces (instead of interpolating the vertex colors over the face),
which is convenient when useing the vertex colors as id-maps.

## TLDR; 

- works on Blender 4.4 (and likely on 4.5 but not tested)

- full documentation in the [docs folder](/docs/)

- latest installable add-on in releases

There is a short tutorial video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV4K4ZFeFKI

Enjoy!
